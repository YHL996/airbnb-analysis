Porject title: Airbnb Superhost Analysis

This project proposed a data-driven business strategy for Airbnb. First, we proved that superhosts can earn higher revenue than normal hosts using difference-in-difference estimation. Second, we built a Gradient Boosting model to predict potential superhosts. Lastly, we recommended AirBnb provides customized incentive for these potential superhosts to drive Airbnb's profit based on our revenue-predicting model.
